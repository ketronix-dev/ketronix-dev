# Hello, everybody!

I'm glad you came to my profile. It means that I or my project interest you. And if so, I suggest you tell me a little about yourself.

## Who am I?

My name is Artem Dadashyants. I'm 18 years old, and I live in Ukraine.

My main occupation is game development in Unity. But recently I have also been developing system utilities in C#. For example, I wrote a manager of AppImage integration into the system both from a file and from remote repository.

At this moment I am studying at NURE, as a system programmer.

My main OS is Linux, besides I do a little bit of blogging related to this OS.
